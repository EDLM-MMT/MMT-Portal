            "solution": "The JST is set up to send official electronic transcripts to institutes so for the most part transcripts are delivered electronically. Official transcripts are not provided to individuals. If you need to have a transcript special mailed please complete a Special Mail Request form with the employer/program information and upload to this website, fax, or e-mail to jst@doded.mil. A point-of-contact must be included on the form or request will not be processed."
